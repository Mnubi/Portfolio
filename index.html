            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>Education Background</strong> <br> I went to Glory Primary School then I joined Langata High School for my KCSE examination. <br> I graduated and later Joined Kenya Institute of Highway and building Technology, where I Studied Architecture. <br><br>
                <strong>Work Experince</strong><br> In 2017 I joined Sava Builders, worked there for two and half years as a scaffold engineer.
                <em>my duties were</em>

                <ol>
                    <li>Plan work for the day</li>
                    <li>Organize operatives in groups e.g one group for repair</li>
                    <li>Report any faulty scaffold</li>
                    <li>Call out daily roll calls, register</li>
                </ol>
                <br>

                In August 2019, I was able to join LSG Skychef in JKIA, Nairobi. I was assigned under Production Unit where our duties include
                <ul>
                    <li>To make sure our production area was clean at all times</li>
                    <li>There is no broken plate i.e. That was very hazardous to health</li>
                    <li>organized plates and cutterly for flight</li>
                    <li>Keep inventory records and update the manager </li>
                </ul>
                <strong>Moringa Opportunity</strong> <br> I never got to  finish my studies at KIHBT (Kenya Institute of Highway and Building Technology), so when I heard of the chance I had to give it a shot. Its a chance to learn something new to be part of the global team that shapes the world with technology.<br>
                <br>
